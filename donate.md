    content: "<strong>About Us<br></strong>At CRY, being one of the most trusted NGOs
      in India, we’re committed to doing everything we can to protect the rights of
      children. We work on 4 key programmatic areas for children: education, safety
      &amp; protection, health &amp; nutrition and participation. To create a sustainable
      change for India’s children we address their critical needs by working with
      parents, teachers, Anganwadi workers, communities, district and state-level
      governments as well as the children themselves. Thanks to the support of people
      like you, so far we’ve impacted over 3 million children in India."

    headline: Agaram Foundation
    slug: ''
    content: "<strong>About Us</strong><br>India is on the cusp of change. The country
      is marching into the 21st century, rightly proud of all its advancements in
      science and technology, its spectacular improvements in infrastructure and IT.
      And yet, we're weighed down by devastating inequalities, by a huge population
      that remains untouched by well- meaning acts like the Right to Education, and
      a large gender inequality. At Agaram, we want to make a difference in the lives
      of the millions who are not yet touched by education."
