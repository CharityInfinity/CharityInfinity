    description: '<strong>About Us</strong><br>At CRY, being one of the most trusted
      NGOs in India, we’re committed to doing everything we can to protect the rights
      of children. We work on 4 key programmatic areas for children: education, safety
      &amp; protection, health &amp; nutrition and participation. To create a sustainable
      change for India’s children we address their critical needs by working with
      parents, teachers, Anganwadi workers, communities, district and state-level
      governments as well as the children themselves. Thanks to the support of people
      like you, so far we’ve impacted over 3 million children in India.<br><br>click
