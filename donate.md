      to doing everything we can to protect the rights of children. We work on 4 key
      programmatic areas for children: education, safety &amp; protection, health
      &amp; nutrition and participation. To create a sustainable change for India’s
      children we address their critical needs by working with parents, teachers,
      Anganwadi workers, communities, district and state-level governments as well
      as the children themselves. Thanks to the support of people like you, so far
      we’ve impacted over 3 million children in India.<br><br><a href="https://akashmanoharan.github.io/ubuild-jekyll/cry"

    content: India is on the cusp of change. The country is marching into the 21st
      century, rightly proud of all its advancements in science and technology, its
      spectacular improvements in infrastructure and IT. And yet, we're weighed down
      by devastating inequalities, by a huge population that remains untouched by
      well- meaning acts like the Right to Education, and a large gender inequality.
      At Agaram, we want to make a difference in the lives of the millions who are
      not yet touched by education.<br><br><a href="https://agaram.in/" title="Agaram
