  content: "<strong>How these corpus funds are created?<br><br></strong>Corpus funds
    are created out of donations which are specifically directed towards corpus funds.
    In fact, for being eligible as corpus donation, any voluntary contribution needs
    to carry a written specific direction to that effect from the donor. There is
    also another way to create corpus fund. The organization can create corpus fund
    from its internal accruals or surplus. The organization can add a maximum of 15%
    of its total donations received in a year for its corpus fund."
