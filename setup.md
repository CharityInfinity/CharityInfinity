  content: "<strong>How these corpus funds are created?<br><br></strong>Corpus funds
    are created out of donations which are specifically directed towards corpus funds.
    In fact, for being eligible as corpus donation, any voluntary contribution needs
    to carry a written specific direction to that effect from the donor.<strong><br><br></strong>There
    is also another way to create corpus fund. The organization can create corpus
    fund from its internal accruals or surplus. The organization can create corpus
    fund from 15% of its income because only 85% is available for application towards
    charitable purposes."
