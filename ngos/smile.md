    of Smile<br></strong>The groundwork for a better life lies in education. It is
    the most powerful catalyst for social transformation. However, a child cannot
    be educated in isolation. Only an empowered family, especially the mother, would
    be willing to educate their child. Thus, rather than focusing on only one stage
    of a person's life, we believe in the lifecycle approach.<br><br><a href="https://donate.smilefoundationindia.org/"
