  content: <strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">Corpus Fund:<br> </span></strong><span
    class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">From a layman’s point of view, a corpus fund
    should be understood as the capital of the organization; the funds generated and
    kept for the existence and sustenance(support) of the organization. It can simply
    be also called as “Emergency Fund”, as it is also used to help sustain the difficult
    times of an NGO.<br><br></span><strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">Need
    of corpus funding:<br> </span></strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">An
    important aspect of the Corpus fund is that, with general body meeting approval,
    it can also be used to keep continuity in an organization activity, say, when
    the grant is still not received from the donor organization. In such cases, there
    are two options for an NGO- either make some temporary arrangement or delay the
    activity. If an NGO has just limited fund, as it depends only on the foreign grant,
    any delay in the grant will lead to a pause or delay in the project activity.
    Corpus, in such cases, works as a temporary grant arrangement to keep the activity
    continued. NGOs receive limited funds to run the program activities as the approved
    budget. There are certain regular expenses, which do not get funded through this.
    In such cases, these expenses can be covered from the corpus funds. For example-
    Rent for a building. And thus, the corpus helps to keep an organization financially
    secured.</span>

    fund:<br> </span></strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">There are two
    ways of getting corpus funds:<br></span><strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653
    BCX0"> Income or surplus-</span></strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">
    There may be different rules in the different country towards this. For example,
    in India; as per the Income Tax act, only 15% of the organization income or surplus
    can be transferred to the corpus fund. Rest 85% has to be used to fund program
    activities.<br> <br></span><strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">Donations</span></strong><span
    class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">- Corpus can be received as a donation. But,
    any donation that is received this way, must be clearly stated by the donor that
    she/ he is contributing towards the corpus. Without any written consent from the
    donor, the additional funds cannot be transferred to the corpus. In case of donation,
    if there are no such written briefs, NGO can go back to get such written consent.<br>
    <br></span><strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">For example</span></strong><span
    class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">, In India, the financial year closing is on
    31st March. Sometimes, NGOs receive a huge grant in February, as March is the
    last month of the financial year and the donors need to give away the sanctioned/pledged
    money for the respective development cause. Now, the NGO may be unable to utilize
    the grant within that financial year (practically only 1-2 months remaining).
    One of the alternatives for the NGO would be to go back to Grant donor requesting
    to mark their donation as Corpus. It can only be considered corpus after receiving
    the consent, in writing.<br><br><br></span><strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653
