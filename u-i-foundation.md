  content: "<strong>Purpose of U&amp;I</strong> : U&amp;I has 2 key programs - <strong>U&amp;I
    Teach</strong> : 9 out of 10 students who study in government schools drop out
    before the 10th grade. U&amp;I Teach is an after school program that aims to educate
    the lesser privileged youth and help them stay in school. <strong>U&amp;I Care</strong>
    : The vision for U&amp;I Care is to transform institutional care in our nation.
    All across the country are homes which house thousands of women and children,
    in desperate need of care, rehabilitation and support. Our vision is to work with
    these homes and transform them into model homes which empower their inmates to
    lead a fruitful and fulfilling life.<br><br><strong>For Corpus Funding : </strong>We
    can donate to U&amp;I's corpus by sending a wire transfer to the bank details
    and following it up with an email to accounts@uandi.org.in and ajit@uandi.org.in
    stating that the amount donated is to go towards U&amp;I's corpus.  "
