  headline: "<strong>what is Corpus Fund?</strong>"
  content: '<strong>Corpus Fund:<br></strong>Corpus Fund can be considered as a capital
    of the organization where the funds can be generated and kept for the existence
    and support for the organization. It will be more helpful for the NGO to sustain
    during the difficult times. It is also known as "Emergency Fund".<br><br><strong>Need
    of corpus funding:<br></strong>An important aspect of going with corpus fund is
    that, it can be used for continuing the organization activity, If the grant is
    not received from the donor. There are two options available for the NGO, if the
    grant is not received from the donor, one is making some temporary arrangements
    or delay the activity. But the NGO is completely depends on the grant from the
    donor, since there is limited fund available in the NGO, then we need to pause
    or delay the activity. But we have corpus funds , we can use it for making the
    temporary arrangements to continue the activity. And also grant received from
    donor is an exact budget for running the program and some of the regular expenses
    won''t be covered in that budget, for example: paying rent for the building and
    so on. So we can use the corpus funds for that. Corpus Funds helps the organization
    to be financially secured.'

  content: '<strong>Ways of getting corpus fund:<br></strong>There are only two ways
    for getting the corpus funds:<br><strong>Donations- </strong>Corpus Fund can be
    received through donation. But the donor needs to clearly mention that the grant
    should be corpus in written statement. Without written statement, the amount should
    not be considered as a corpus fund. In such cases, NGO can go back to the donor
    and get the written statement that it is for corpus.<br><strong>Income or Surplus-</strong>
    There are different rules in different countries for this option. In India, Only
    15% of the organization income can be transferred to the corpus fund as per the
    Income Tax Act. The Remaining 85% income should be used for NGO activities.<br><br><strong>For
    example</strong>, We can consider a real time situation, If the NGO gets the huge
    grant during the month of February. The donor has donated the amount for specific
    development cause. But the financial year ends on 31st March in India. Now, the
    NGO can''t spend the 85% of the grant within March 31st and practically it is
    not possible also. So, the best way is that the NGO needs to go back to the donor
    and request to mark the grant amount as corpus. If the donor accepts and mention
    that in written manner, the grant will be considered as a corpus fund.<br><br><strong>YouTube
