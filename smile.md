  headline: "<strong>Smile Foundation</strong>"
  content: "<strong>Purpose of Smile<br></strong>The groundwork for a better life
    lies in education. It is the most powerful catalyst for social transformation.
    However, a child cannot be educated in isolation. Only an empowered family, especially
    the mother, would be willing to educate their child. Thus, rather than focusing
    on only one stage of a person's life, we believe in the lifecycle approach."
