  content: "<strong>How it works:​</strong><br>Every contribution is treated as a
    principal amount and the profits are donated to NGO of user’s choice once per
    year.​<br>The principal amount is invested in an index fund or in a well-established
    mutual fund.​<br>Since profits are calculated after factoring in inflation, the
    principal amount value will not ideally diminish forever."
