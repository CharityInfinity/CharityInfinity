  content: <strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">Corpus Fund:<br> </span></strong><span
    class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">Corpus Fund can be considered as a capital of the organization 
    where the funds can be generated and kept for the existence and 
    support for the organization. It will be more helpful for the NGO to 
    sustain during the difficult times. It is also known as "Emergency 
    Fund".<br><br></span><strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">Need
    of corpus funding:<br> </span></strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">
    The main idea of going with corpus fund is that, it can be used for 
    continuing the organization activity, If the grant is not received 
    from the donor. There are two options available for the NGO, if the 
    grant is not received from the donor, one is making some 
    temporary arrangements or delay the activity. But the NGO is 
    completely depends on the grant from the donor, since there is 
    limited fund availble in the NGO, then we need to pause or delay 
    the activity. But we have corpus funds , we can use it for making the 
    temporary arrangements to continue the activity. And also grant 
    received from donor is an exact budget for running the program 
    and some of the regular expenses won't be covered in that budget, 
    for example: paying rent for the building and so on. So we can use 
    the corpus funds for that. Corpus Funds helps the organization to 
    be financially secured.</span>

    fund:<br> </span></strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">There are two
    ways of getting corpus funds:<br></span><strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653
    BCX0"> Income or surplus-</span></strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">
    There may be different rules in the different country towards this. For example,
    in India; as per the Income Tax act, only 15% of the organization income or surplus
    can be transferred to the corpus fund. Rest 85% has to be used to fund program
    activities.<br> <br></span><strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">Donations</span></strong><span
    class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">- Corpus can be received as a donation. But,
    any donation that is received this way, must be clearly stated by the donor that
    she/ he is contributing towards the corpus. Without any written consent from the
    donor, the additional funds cannot be transferred to the corpus. In case of donation,
    if there are no such written briefs, NGO can go back to get such written consent.<br>
    <br></span><strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">For example</span></strong><span
    class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">, In India, the financial year closing is on
    31st March. Sometimes, NGOs receive a huge grant in February, as March is the
    last month of the financial year and the donors need to give away the sanctioned/pledged
    money for the respective development cause. Now, the NGO may be unable to utilize
    the grant within that financial year (practically only 1-2 months remaining).
    One of the alternatives for the NGO would be to go back to Grant donor requesting
    to mark their donation as Corpus. It can only be considered corpus after receiving
    the consent, in writing.<br><br><br></span><strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653
