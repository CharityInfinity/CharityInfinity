  content: <strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">Corpus Fund:<br> </span></strong><span
    class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">Corpus Fund can be considered as a capital of the organization 
    where the funds can be generated and kept for the existence and 
    support for the organization. It will be more helpful for the NGO to 
    sustain during the difficult times. It is also known as "Emergency 
    Fund".<br><br></span><strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">Need
    of corpus funding:<br> </span></strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">An
    important aspect of the Corpus fund is that, with general body meeting approval,
    it can also be used to keep continuity in an organization activity, say, when
    the grant is still not received from the donor organization. In such cases, there
    are two options for an NGO- either make some temporary arrangement or delay the
    activity. If an NGO has just limited fund, as it depends only on the foreign grant,
    any delay in the grant will lead to a pause or delay in the project activity.
    Corpus, in such cases, works as a temporary grant arrangement to keep the activity
    continued. NGOs receive limited funds to run the program activities as the approved
    budget. There are certain regular expenses, which do not get funded through this.
    In such cases, these expenses can be covered from the corpus funds. For example-
    Rent for a building. And thus, the corpus helps to keep an organization financially
    secured.</span>

    fund:<br> </span></strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">There are only 
    two ways for getting the corpus funds:<br></span><strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653
    BCX0"> Donations- </span></strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">
    Corpus Fund can be received through donation. But the donor 
    needs to clearly mention that the grant should be corpus in written statement. 
    Without written statement, the amount should not be considered as a corpus fund. 
    In such cases, NGO can go back to the donor and get the written statement that it is 
    for corpus.<br> <br></span><strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">Income or Surplus </span></strong><span
    class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">- There are different rules in different countries for this option. In India, 
    Only 15% of the organization income can be transferred to the corpus fund as per 
    the Income Tax Act. The Remaining 85% income should be used for NGO activities.<br>
    <br></span><strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">For example</span></strong><span
    class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">, We can consider a real time situation, If the NGO gets the huge grant 
    during the month of Februray. The donor has donated the amount for specific 
    development cause. But the financial year ends on 31st March in India. Now, the 
    NGO can't spend the 85% of the grant within March 31st and practically it is not 
    possible also. So, the best way is that the NGO needs to go back to the donor and 
    request to mark the grant amount as corpus. If the donor accepts and mention that 
    in written manner, the grant will be considered as a corpus fund.
