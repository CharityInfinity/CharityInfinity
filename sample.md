  content: <strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">Corpus Fund:<br> </span></strong><span
    class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">From a layman’s point of view, a corpus fund
    should be understood as the capital of the organization; the funds generated and
    kept for the existence and sustenance(support) of the organization. It can simply
    be also called as “Emergency Fund”, as it is also used to help sustain the difficult
    times of an NGO.<br><br></span><strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">Need
    of corpus funding:<br> </span></strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">An
    important aspect of the Corpus fund is that, with general body meeting approval,
    it can also be used to keep continuity in an organization activity, say, when
    the grant is still not received from the donor organization. In such cases, there
    are two options for an NGO- either make some temporary arrangement or delay the
    activity. If an NGO has just limited fund, as it depends only on the foreign grant,
    any delay in the grant will lead to a pause or delay in the project activity.
    Corpus, in such cases, works as a temporary grant arrangement to keep the activity
    continued. NGOs receive limited funds to run the program activities as the approved
    budget. There are certain regular expenses, which do not get funded through this.
    In such cases, these expenses can be covered from the corpus funds. For example-
    Rent for a building. And thus, the corpus helps to keep an organization financially
    secured.</span>
