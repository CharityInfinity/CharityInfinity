  content: '<strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">Corpus Fund:<br>    </span></strong><span
    class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">From a layman’s point of view, a corpus fund
    should be understood as the capital of the organization; the funds generated and
    kept for the existence and sustenance(support) of the organization. It can simply
    be also called as “Emergency Fund”, as it is also used to help sustain the difficult
    times of an NGO.<br><br></span><strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">Need
    of corpus funding:<br>    </span></strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">An
    important aspect of the Corpus fund is that, with general body meeting approval,
    it can also be used to keep continuity in an organization activity, say, when
    the grant is still not received from the donor organization. In such cases, there
    are two options for an NGO- either make some temporary arrangement or delay the
    activity. If an NGO has just limited fund, as it depends only on the foreign grant,
    any delay in the grant will lead to a pause or delay in the project activity.
    Corpus, in such cases, works as a temporary grant arrangement to keep the activity
    continued. NGOs receive limited funds to run the program activities as the approved
    budget. There are certain regular expenses, which do not get funded through this.
    In such cases, these expenses can be covered from the corpus funds. For example-
    Rent for a building. And thus, the corpus helps to keep an organization financially
    secured.<br><br></span><strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653 BCX0">Ways of
    getting corpus fund:<br>    </span></strong><span class="TextRun SCXW36978653
    BCX0">There are two ways of getting corpus funds: Income or surplus- There may
    be different rules in the different country towards this. For example, in India;
    as per the Income Tax act, only 15% of the organization income or surplus can
    be transferred to the corpus fund. Rest 85% has to be used to fund program activities.
    Donations- Corpus can be received as a donation. But, any donation that is received
    this way, must be clearly stated by the donor that she/ he is contributing towards
    the corpus. Without any written consent from the donor, the additional funds cannot
    be transferred to the corpus. In case of donation, if there are no such written
    briefs, NGO can go back to get such written consent. For example, In India, the
    financial year closing is on 31st March. Sometimes, NGOs receive a huge grant
    in February, as March is the last month of the financial year and the donors need
    to give away the sanctioned/pledged money for the respective development cause.
    Now, the NGO may be unable to utilize the grant within that financial year (practically
    only 1-2 months remaining). One of the alternatives for the NGO would be to go
    back to Grant donor requesting to mark their donation as Corpus. It can only be
    considered corpus after receiving the consent, in writing.</span>'
