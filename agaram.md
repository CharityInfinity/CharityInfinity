    as a principal amount and the profits are donated to NGO of user’s choice once
    per year.​</p><p>The principal amount is invested in an index fund or in a well-established
    mutual funds.​</p><p>Since profits are calculated after factoring in inflation,
    the principal amount value will not ideally diminish forever.</p>"
